# Shooter!
A really fun client-side javascript game with a server in node.js hosted on heroku

You can play it here[http://shoooter.herokuapp.com]

To run locally install mongodb, then initialize the database by entering in the terminal
```
mongod
```

Then install node, and in the root directory enter in the command line
```
node shooter.js
```
to create a local server.  Then the game will be running at http://localhost:5000/

To contribute, make changes to the logic.js file located in the static folder
